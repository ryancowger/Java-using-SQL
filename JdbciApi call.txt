// 1. THE REASON FOR IMPORTING THE FOLLOWING LIBRARIES IS java.sql.Connection is for establishing a connection to a database
// 2. When you are using JDBC outside of an application server, the DriverManager class manages the establishment of connections.
// 3. An SQLException can occur both in the driver and the database. When such an exception occurs, an object of type SQLException will be passed to the catch clause.

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

         String uName = "bsmith"; 
         String uPass = "roxie"; 
   
         // 2. THE PURPOSE (RESULT) OF THE FOLLOWING API CALL IS this establishes a connection to the host with the user name and password.
         Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(host, uName, uPass);    
         
         // 3. THE PURPOSE (RESULT) OF THE FOLLOWING API CALLS IS The below statment executes a query by selecting the database Stu_id Then it gets the table Stu_Name from Row Stu_Class_1. I would have to see the database to know that for sure. 
         Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();                         
         String sql = "select  Stu_id, Stu_Name from Stu_Class_1";

         System.out.println("Displaying student information: ");     
    
         
         // 4. THE RESULT OF THE FOLLOWING API CALLS IS It would be what ever is stored in the Student_id is associated with name Then it would say the students name.
         while (rs.next()) {

             System.out.println ("Student id " + rs.getString("Stu_id");

      } 
      // 5. THE PURPOSE OF THE FOLLOWING CATCH BLOCK Is This is the error you recieve if the program fails! 
      catch ( SQLException err ) {
         System.out.println(err.getMessage());
